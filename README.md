# Polar Town

This is demo Phoenix application for handling services in a remote town.

The first implementation is for booking parkings.
However, many more services are on the wishing list to be implemented.

The implementation requires
- Tailwind CSS for the CSS style and forms.
- Leafet.js for rendering the map.
- Flatpickr.js for selecting the reservation dates.
- Open source icons are taken from `icons8.com`
- Other libraries will be added as required.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
